# nl-corona
Quick-and-dirty scraper to load csv data from the [RIVM Corona map](https://www.rivm.nl/coronavirus-kaart-van-nederland) of the Netherlands. 

Currently just stores the data in a CSV file named after the data's timestamp. 

The script will be expanded in the forseeable future to merge and process data from different timestamps, and analyze it. 
After these additions, unit tests will be added.
